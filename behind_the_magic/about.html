        <h2>FIRST AND ONLY WORLD CLASS THEME PARK IN THE PHILIPPINES</h2>

            FIRST AND ONLY WORLD CLASS THEME PARK IN THE PHILIPPINES
Enchanted Kingdom opened to the public on October 19, 1995. It was and still is the first and only world-class theme park in the Philippines. The theme park boasts of rides and attractions unique to the country in size and magnitude. These rides and attractions are located within seven meticulously themed zones interspersed with food and merchandise outlets and kiosks as well as various game stands that add to the “enchanting experience”, away from the day-to-day realities of life.

Enchanted Kingdom is also a choice venue for (1) personal milestones, such as birthdays, weddings, and debuts; (2) corporate events, namely, conferences, company anniversaries, awarding ceremonies, product launches, and EK Magicalympics team building; and (3) school events, such as commencement exercises, Junior-Senior prom, and sports events.
Enchanted Kingdom can cater to in-park group reservations from 10,000 to 25,000 guests in various themed environments in the Park’s seven zones or in its enchanting events venues: Eldar’s Theater (600-seater), Boardwalk Party Place (300-seater), and Enchanting Events Place (2,000-seater).

Enchanted Kingdom boasts of “themed entertainment” in each zone. It also has a variety of musical shows throughout the season using in-house and TV network partner talents. Entertainment and special events are usually held at any of the aforementioned venues.

Currently, Enchanted Kingdom is exploring ways to expand into other ventures like Edutainment. Through the spirit of participation in education-related undertakings, the theme park can greatly help in the future of the country’s educational backbone.
